## Overview

I recently participated in **Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation** on the Forage platform. This experience was incredibly valuable in understanding the dynamics of a typical project team at Accenture and in applying Excel and data analytics skills in a realistic context.

## 🌟 Key Responsibilities

- **Client Advisory:** Advised a hypothetical social media client on content trends using data analytics.
- **Data Analysis:** Cleaned, modeled, and analyzed seven datasets to uncover actionable insights.
- **Communication:** Developed and delivered a PowerPoint presentation and video to communicate findings to the client and internal stakeholders.

## 🔍 Data Analysis Process

1. **Data Overview:** Analyzed seven datasets, each containing various columns and values. Utilized a data model to show relationships and facilitate merging of tables.
2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed rows with missing values.
   - Changed data types within columns as necessary.
   - Removed irrelevant columns.
3. **Data Merging:** Created a final dataset by merging the tables using the `VLOOKUP` function.
4. **Data Analysis Techniques:** Employed conditional functions such as `IFS`, `SUMIFS`, and `COUNTIF`, as well as pivot tables, filters, and sorting functions to analyze the cleaned data.

## 💡 Key Learnings and Aspirations

Through this program, I discovered my passion for:
- Cleaning, modeling, and analyzing client data
- Creating insightful slides
- Presenting findings to clients

I am eager to apply these skills in a diverse project team at a company like Accenture.
